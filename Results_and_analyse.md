First AI : Rule based AI    
    This was my first project here as I thought it would be the easiest and fastest way to get results. Even though the results themselves are not that good, I am still happy as this was my first ever bot. If i wanted to I could probably change the parameters and code to make it increasingly better but this is not my goal. Now, I want to create a bot that learns by itself.

Second AI : Q-learningâ€“based AI
    This was a ... questionnable decision xD. I wanted to try it out and didn't think of all the possibilities tetris actully offers ... As expected, the results are way bellow what I was expecting and I think there is no point running it more as it will take many many efforts to make it ok, let's not talk about good.

Next step : Genetic Algorithms
    My current project, I hope this will help me get a bot that learns by itself and gets actually good at the game. I know it is more complex then any other thing I tried until now but wouldn't be un otherwise would it ;)
