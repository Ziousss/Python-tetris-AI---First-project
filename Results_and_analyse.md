First AI : Rule based AI    
    This was my first project here as I thought it would be the easiest and fastest way to get results. Even though the results themselves are not that good, I am still happy as this was my first ever bot. If i wanted to I could probably change the parameters and code to make it increasingly better but this is not my goal. Now, I want to create a bot that learns by itself or evolves.

    Looking back, my bot was probably bad because of the way i coded it ... 

Second AI : Q-learningâ€“based AI
    This was a ... questionable decision xD. I wanted to try it out and didn't think of all the possibilities tetris actually offers ... As expected, the results are way below what I was expecting and I think there is no point running it more as it will take many many efforts to make it ok, let's not talk about good.

Third : Genetic Algorithms
    Well ... it worked out pretty well xd. So in my first approach I only computed the current move and had some good results having a highest score of almost 300k only on lines clear without multiplier. Then I added the possibility of looking one move ahead and this helped the bot averaging ~100k. Now that my bot is finished, I wanted to have fun and pretend as if it was a human, so I changed the score_count function to implement a level concept. This does not matter for the bot obviously but i wanted to compare it to my friends' score ... it destroyed them achieving at least a highest of 8 million score. Due to my machine, I will not run several generation because it would take too much time, but the bot can still be improved and probably optimized a lot. For example, right now, the bot cannot move during the fall of the piece. This means that he is incapable of doing a T spin and other moves that would maybe make him unkillable. 

I consider this project to be a success since I coded a bot that evolves with the genetic one, one that learned some basis about the Q-learning and coded a Rule based only one. In addition to the technical skills I gained, I improved other valuable skills such as thinking like a developer and coming up with solutions to problems (for some reason the collision functions were a nightmare to debug xd).

If you want to continue my work, feel free to do so and keep me updated of your progress.
Code, improve your skills and have fun ;)
